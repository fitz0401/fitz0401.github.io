I am currently a Ph.D. student at [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/kuleuven/), supervised by [Prof. Renaud Detry](https://renaud-detry.net/).

Before that, I was an algorithm engineer at [Baidu](https://ir.baidu.com/) Intelligent Driving Group (IDG), responsible for [Apollo Navigation Pilot (ANP)](https://en.apollo.auto/anp) of [Jiyue](https://www.jidu.com/).

I got my master's degree from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) in 2024, supervised by [Prof. Weizhong Guo](https://me.sjtu.edu.cn/en/FullTimeTeacher/guoweizhong.html), and my bachelor's degree from [Xi'an Jiao Tong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/) in 2021.

My primary focus is on mobile robots and embodied intelligence. I am also a firm believer in the eventual realization of artificial general intelligence (AGI), and I am excited to be a part of this rapidly evolving field.

The following are my current research interests.

- Mobile Robots
- Decision-making & Planning
- Emobodied AI
- Autonomous Driving
