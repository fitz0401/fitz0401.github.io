I am currently a Master Student at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), majoring in robotics, and my supervisor is [Prof. Weizhong Guo](https://me.sjtu.edu.cn/en/FullTimeTeacher/guoweizhong.html). I got my bachelor's degree from College of Mechanical Engineering, [Xi'an Jiao Tong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/) in 2021.

My primary focus is on mobile robots and embodied intelligence. I am also a firm believer in the eventual realization of artificial general intelligence (AGI), and I am excited to be a part of this rapidly evolving field.

The following are my current research interests.

- Mobile Robots
- Decision-making & Planning
- Emobodied AI
- Autonomous Driving
